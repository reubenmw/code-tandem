			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup CLI Framework and Configuration Management",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of setting up the CLI and configuration management. Create subtasks for: 1. Initializing the project with a chosen CLI framework (e.g., Typer). 2. Designing and implementing the configuration module to handle settings like provider and model. 3. Implementing the secure storage and retrieval of API keys using a cross-platform solution like the system keychain. 4. Adding the `codetandem config` command with its subcommands (`set`, `get`, etc.) to the CLI.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task with moderate complexity. While setting up a CLI framework is straightforward, implementing secure, cross-platform storage for API keys (e.g., using a system keychain) introduces non-trivial challenges and dependencies. The design of the configuration module also needs to be extensible for future providers."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Project Initialization (`codetandem init`)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the `codetandem init` command implementation. Create subtasks for: 1. Developing a module to recursively scan a project directory and represent it as a file tree. 2. Creating a robust parser for the Markdown curriculum file to extract modules and objectives. 3. Designing the schema and implementing the generation logic for `modules.json`. 4. Designing the schema and implementing the generation logic for the initial `codetandem.state.json`.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct components: file system traversal, Markdown parsing, and structured data generation. Each of these has its own edge cases. Ensuring the Markdown parser is robust and that the generated state files are correctly structured based on two different inputs (file tree and curriculum) makes this moderately complex."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Abstract AI Provider Service Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the AI provider service layer. Create subtasks for: 1. Designing a common `BaseAIProvider` interface with methods like `generate_code_suggestion` and `review_code`. 2. Implementing a concrete provider class for a specific service (e.g., `OpenAIProvider`) that handles its API requests and responses. 3. Implementing a second concrete provider class (e.g., `GeminiProvider`). 4. Creating a factory function that reads the application configuration and returns an instance of the correct provider.",
			"reasoning": "The core challenge here is architectural. Designing a flexible, model-agnostic abstraction that can accommodate the nuances of different LLM provider APIs is a significant task. While implementing a single provider is straightforward, creating a robust layer for multiple providers, along with the necessary testing mocks, increases the complexity."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Tandem Coding Loop (`codetandem next`)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the core `codetandem next` command. Create subtasks for: 1. Reading the current project state and learning objective. 2. Implementing the prompt engineering logic to construct a comprehensive context for the AI. 3. Calling the AI service and handling the response. 4. Developing a robust parser to extract the target file and code changes from the AI's response. 5. Implementing the logic to safely apply the code modifications to the user's file system and insert the `// TODO` comment.",
			"reasoning": "This is the core feature and is highly complex. It orchestrates state management, complex prompt engineering, interaction with an external AI service, and direct, potentially risky, file system manipulation. Reliably parsing the AI's response and applying code changes correctly is a major technical challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Interactive Code Review (`codetandem submit`)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the `codetandem submit` command. Create subtasks for: 1. Developing a parser to find the relevant `// TODO` and extract the user's code changes. 2. Integrating a static analysis/linter tool and running it on the extracted code. 3. Implementing the prompt engineering logic to request a code review from the AI service. 4. Parsing the AI's feedback and determining if the submission was successful. 5. Updating the skill score and progress in `codetandem.state.json`.",
			"reasoning": "This task is as complex as the `next` command. It involves several challenging steps: reliably extracting user-written code, integrating and managing external linter processes, crafting effective prompts for code review (which is different from code generation), and parsing structured feedback from the AI to update user state."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Dynamic Scaffolding and Skill Scoring",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of dynamic scaffolding. Create subtasks for: 1. Modifying the `codetandem.state.json` schema and updating the `submit` command to increment a module's skill score upon success. 2. Enhancing the `next` command to read the current skill score before generating a task. 3. Implementing the conditional prompt logic within the `next` command to request different levels of detail from the AI based on the user's skill score.",
			"reasoning": "While this task modifies existing complex commands, the changes are localized. The primary complexity lies in designing and tuning the prompt engineering logic to effectively translate a numerical skill score into meaningful variations in AI-generated tasks. This requires significant experimentation and refinement."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Control Commands (`hint`, `solve`, `set_level`)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of user control commands. Create subtasks for: 1. Building the `hint` command, which queries the AI for help on the current task. 2. Building the `solve` command, which uses the AI to complete the task and updates the state file. 3. Building the `set_level` command to manually override the difficulty and ensuring the `next` command respects this setting.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating three distinct commands that interact with the core application state and AI service. The `hint` command requires logic for progressive disclosure, and the `solve` command reuses complex code-writing logic. The combined effort of implementing, testing, and integrating these three separate user flows justifies the complexity score."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance `init` with Documentation Ingestion and Taskmaster Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhancement of the `init` command. Create subtasks for: 1. Implementing the documentation ingestion pipeline using the `--docs` flag, including scraping, chunking, and embedding. 2. Integrating a local vector database to store and query the ingested documentation. 3. Implementing the Taskmaster `prd.md` and `tasks.json` parsers. 4. Developing the logic to create the Curriculum-Backlog Map and integrate it into `modules.json`. 5. Adding the new optional flags and logic to the existing `init` command.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces several technologically complex components into an existing command. Web scraping, text chunking, vector embeddings, and managing a local vector store are all non-trivial. This significantly expands the scope and dependencies of the `init` command, making it a high-complexity task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Module Assessment (`codetandem test`)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the `codetandem test` command. Create subtasks for: 1. Developing the logic to determine when a module is complete and ready for assessment. 2. Implementing the prompt engineering to have the AI generate a suitable 'capstone' task for the module. 3. Modifying the `submit` command to handle the grading of these assessment tasks. 4. Implementing the state transition logic to mark a module as complete and unlock the next one upon a successful test.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces a new, important workflow into the application. While it leverages existing components like the `submit` command, the complexity comes from managing the application's state transitions (e.g., moving from learning mode to assessment mode) and the specific prompt engineering required to generate a meaningful 'capstone' task from the AI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Package for Cross-Platform Distribution",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of packaging the application. Create subtasks for: 1. Setting up and configuring a packaging tool like PyInstaller to create a standalone executable. 2. Creating a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build process. 3. Configuring separate build jobs within the workflow for Linux, Windows, and macOS. 4. Writing clear, cross-platform installation instructions for the README.",
			"reasoning": "This is a DevOps-heavy task with high complexity. While it doesn't involve application logic, setting up, debugging, and maintaining a CI/CD pipeline that builds and packages a non-trivial application for three different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) is a significant challenge. Each platform has its own quirks and dependencies that must be managed."
