# Task ID: 10
# Title: Package for Cross-Platform Distribution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create build and packaging scripts to produce standalone executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring the CLI tool is easily installable for all target users.
# Details:
Use a tool like `PyInstaller` or `cx_Freeze` for Python to bundle the application and its dependencies into a single executable for each target OS. Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate the build process for each platform. Write clear installation instructions in the project's README file.

# Test Strategy:
Build the executable on each target platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). Run the executables in a clean environment to ensure they start correctly and all dependencies are included. Perform a basic smoke test by running the `init` and `config` commands to confirm functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure PyInstaller for Standalone Executable Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure PyInstaller to bundle the Python application and all its dependencies into a single, standalone executable file. This involves creating a spec file and testing the build locally.
### Details:
Create a `build.spec` file for PyInstaller. Configure it to include all necessary data files, hidden imports, and assets. Test the build process locally on one development machine to ensure a working executable is produced before automating.

## 2. Create Base GitHub Actions Workflow for Automated Builds [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the initial GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) to automate the packaging process. This workflow will trigger on pushes to the main branch and set up the basic environment.
### Details:
Define a new workflow file. Set up the trigger conditions (e.g., `on: push: branches: [ main ]`). Create a single initial job that checks out the code, sets up the correct Python version, and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## 3. Configure Separate Build Jobs for Windows, macOS, and Linux [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Expand the GitHub Actions workflow to include a build matrix or separate jobs for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Each job will build the executable for its respective platform and upload it as a build artifact.
### Details:
Use a `strategy: matrix` in the GitHub Actions workflow to define `os: [windows-latest, macos-latest, ubuntu-latest]`. For each OS, run the PyInstaller build command. Use the `actions/upload-artifact` action to save the generated executable for each platform.

## 4. Update README with Cross-Platform Installation Instructions [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Write clear, step-by-step installation instructions for the packaged executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux users. Add this documentation to the project's README.md file.
### Details:
In README.md, create a new 'Installation' section. Provide links to the GitHub Actions build artifacts or releases page. Explain how to download the correct file for their OS. Include instructions for potential OS-specific steps, like making the file executable on Linux/macOS (`chmod +x`) or dealing with security warnings.
