# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup CLI Framework and Configuration Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project structure for a cross-platform CLI tool and implement the `codetandem config` command for managing AI provider settings and API keys securely.
# Details:
Use a robust CLI framework like Python's `Typer` or `Click`. Implement `codetandem config set provider <name>`, `... set api_key <key>`, and `... set model <model_name>`. API keys must be stored securely in a user-level `.env` file or system keychain, not in plaintext config files. The configuration module should provide easy access to these settings for other parts of the application. Create a modular structure for adding new AI providers later.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for the config module: verify that setting and getting provider, API key, and model works correctly. Test secure storage by ensuring the API key is not stored in a world-readable file and is correctly retrieved. Manually run CLI commands to confirm they update the configuration as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Project Structure with Typer CLI Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic project directory structure, initialize a Python project, and integrate the Typer library as the core CLI framework. This includes creating the main entry point for the `codetandem` command.
### Details:
Create a `main.py` with a Typer app instance. Use Poetry or another package manager to add `typer` as a dependency. The initial setup should support a basic command like `codetandem --version`.

## 2. Design and Implement the Core Configuration Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a Python module to manage application settings. This module will handle loading, accessing, and saving non-sensitive configuration values like AI provider and model name, abstracting the storage mechanism.
### Details:
The module should expose functions like `get_config_value(key)` and `set_config_value(key, value)`. It will manage a user-level configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/codetandem/config.json`).

## 3. Implement Secure API Key Storage and Retrieval [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Integrate a cross-platform library like `keyring` to securely store and retrieve the AI provider's API key using the system's native keychain or credential store, avoiding plaintext storage.
### Details:
Add the `keyring` library as a dependency. Create wrapper functions `set_api_key(service_name, key)` and `get_api_key(service_name)` that the main configuration module will use specifically for API key management.

## 4. Implement `codetandem config` Command with Subcommands [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Implement the `codetandem config` command group using Typer. This will include subcommands like `set` and `get` to allow users to manage their provider, model, and API key from the command line.
### Details:
Create a new Typer command group for `config`. Implement `config set provider <name>`, `config set model <model_name>`, and `config set api_key <key>`. The `set api_key` command must use the secure storage module.
